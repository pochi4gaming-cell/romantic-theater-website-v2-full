Hello love, 
I don’t exactly know how to start this, since I’ve never done this before.
Pero masaya/excited ako, since I know para sayo. 
I'm sorry for the incoming conyo-ness. 
Please be gentle with me. 

You know, when we first began talking,
and I got a glimpse of who you were,
I couldn’t help but start to admire you.
I found myself slowly looking forward to my night shifts,
hoping we'd be online at the same time.

Then, we had our first few dates,
and that’s when I began to feel something deeper.
I found myself liking you more and more.
It was in those moments that I realized I wanted to extend my trip—
to spend more time with you, to hopefully build something more.

Then I had to go back, and honestly,
I thought these feelings would fade—
with time, with distance,
with the conflict of our schedules.
But you continued to show interest, to put in effort,
and that made me think, wow, we both really do care for this.

We spent months learning each other’s schedules and routines,
and during that time, we became more vocal about how we felt.
I got to know you on a deeper level—
your habits, your sleep style, your favorite foods, your cute expression, and so on.
I care for you more than I ever expected.
Somewhere between our dates, deep talks, and FaceTime moments,
my heart learned your name.

I always think about the little note you gave me on our second date with the smiskis, how I was the unexpected surprise. 
It goes the same for you. It was never part of my vacation plan to meet someone amazing, but you happened. 
I was there to window shop, but I found such a great find instead. 
I guess my manifestation was heard. 

Please understand that I respect any answer you have.
I know this is long overdue,
but for the longest time, I’ve wanted to ask…
