[Pochi]
(standing still, voice steady but sincere)
There are words that wait patiently,
words I’ve chosen to keep silent,
afraid of speaking them too soon,
or too late.

(takes a breath)
Today, I choose to speak them.

[Pause.]

I have something to say, something to ask.
But this is not with expectation,
nor with demand,
but with honesty, and patience.

(softly)
You know, when we first began talking,
and I got a glimpse of who you were,
I couldn’t help but admire you. I found myself looking forward to my night shifts,
hoping we'd be online at the same time.
Then, we had our first few dates,
and that’s when I began to feel something deeper.
I found myself liking you more and more.
It was in those moments that I realized I wanted to extend my trip,
to spend more time with you, to build something more.

(pauses, reflecting)
Then I had to go back, and honestly,
I thought these feelings would fade—
with time, with distance,
with the conflict of our schedules.
But you continued to show interest, to put in effort,
and that made me think, wow, we both do really care for this.

We spent months learning each other’s schedules and routines,
and during that time, we became more vocal about how we felt.
I got to know you on a deeper level—
your habits, your sleep style, your favorite foods.
I care for you more than I ever expected.
Somewhere between our dates, deep talks, and FaceTime moments,
my heart learned your name.

(soft smile)
Such a simple feeling, yet it carries so much weight.
But I don’t regret it—not for a second, since it’s with you.

(gently)
Whatever your response may be,
I will respect it,
because this is what I feel,
and I’m true to it.

[Lights fade.]
